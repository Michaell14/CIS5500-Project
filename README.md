# Books2Movies - CIS 5500 Project

## Description of our Project
Our website will help users discover connections between books and movies. By entering favorite books or movies, users will receive personalized recommendations for related titles based on genre. Key features include finding movies based on books and vice versa, smart recommendations based on genre, and sorting by ratings. Using Goodreads, a dataset from Amazonâ€™s most popular books, and an IMDb movies dataset, our SQL-based system will connect books and movies through complex queries, making it a valuable tool for book lovers and movie enthusiasts alike.

## Motivation
Each of our group members is passionate about different forms of entertainment, including reading literature and watching movies. With a constant flow of new books and movies coming out, it is difficult for each of us to decide on what new book or movie to read/watch next. This website will allow us to resolve this pain point by comparing our current favorite books/movies to others that are similar in genre, content, duration, and more. In summary, we hope this application makes it easier for anybody to discover their next source of entertainment.

## Features we will implement
- Ability to input a book title and return movies that have similar genre
- Ability to filter movies based on duration, explicitness, and movie rating
- Multi-page feature to view a movie in a new page. Ex: if "Toy Story" is suggested, then a user can click on the movie poster preview and it will open a new page with web-scrape information from imdb about the movie.
